  <h2>In the future</h2><h>I want to study computer science in college to learn more about technology and programming. I hope to become an engineer so I can use what I’ve learned to solve real problems. I’m excited to keep learning and grow in this field to create new and useful things.

    <h2> Researched Topic: The Importance of Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. 
      In addition to your password, it requires a second factor like a text code or app confirmation. 
      This protects your data even if your password is stolen. According to security experts, 2FA can block over 99% of automated cyber attacks.
